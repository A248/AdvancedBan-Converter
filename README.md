# AdvancedBan-Converter
Funnels AdvancedBan data from local to external storage or vice-versa.


## Notice

Completely untested so far. Be patient - the program was only released on this Monday (16 Dec 19).

## Usage

This guide assumes you have a minecraft server with [AdvancedBan](https://github.com/AdvancedBan) installed.

1. Stop the server.
2. Change your database settings to your preferred new database in the AdvancedBan configuration.
3. Drop AdvancedBan-Converter.jar in your /plugins/ folder.
4. Recommended but optional: Backup your data just in case something goes wrong. If there is an error, I assume no responsibility)
4. Start the server.
5. Scan the server console in case an error occurred. If everything went fine, hooray! Otherwise, contact me for a fix.
6. Uninstall/remove AdvancedBan-Converter.jar from your plugins folder.
7. Restart your server without AdvancedBan-Converter.jar installed. (If you do not remove AdvancedBan-Converter.jar, I assume no responsibility for any possible damages. While it is engineered to not cause any problems in these cases, I make no guarantees).
